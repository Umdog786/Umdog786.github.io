                <h1> About Me </h1>
                <p> I'm Umar and I'm a first year student at NTU studying an MComp in Computer Science. I've studied Computer Science for around 5 years now, starting at GCSE, through A-Level and now currently continuing with it throug University. I want
                    to pursue a job in the industry, particularly in the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning sectors as those are the areas that interest me most. I'm excited about the learning about those areas later in this course, as currently
                    the only way I can learn about them is in my own time.</p>

                <h1> Purpose of this Website </h1>
                <p> CPD stands for Continuing Professional Development and essentially it is a program to allow students to develop themselves personally by taking advantage of the various activities and clubs available at university. The program requires
                    us to partake in at least two different activities, amassing a total of 30 hours of CPD engagement and reflection, gathering evidence as proof of the various activities we have done to collect our hours. The purpose of this website
                    is to show and explain the various activites I chose to do to collect my 30 hours, as well as display the evidence I collected for them. The activites I have partaken in include:
                    <ul>
                        <li> Joining the Developer's Society and taking part in various events </li>
                        <li> Attending various CERT Mentoring meetings </li>
                        <li> Taking part in the Microsoft Major League Hacking event </li>
                        <li> Attending various independant learning courses via LinkedIn Learning </li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Further detail about each of these activites can be found on the corresponding pages within this website, alongside the relevant evidence for each of the activites.</p>
